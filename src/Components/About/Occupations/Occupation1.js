          The bachelor study, at the University of Eindhoven, teaches you a
          variety of skills. We often worked in a multidisciplinary team. So we
          learned how to present and analyze our ideas. We had to be open-minded
          for critic to innovate our thinking. So we often did self-reflect and
          self-criticism.
